My Scratch program is practically a spinoff of the classic game Pacmanâ„¢. 
In this version, you navigate the Gobbleman using the arrow keys. 
You have to eat all the points (the yellow-orange circles). Just make sure to avoid the ghosts (and walls)!
Be careful to navigate around corners as they might make your Gobbleman go crazy (the ghosts sometimes escape the walls too!).

This is part of my CS50x course and is the assignment for the 1st module (0 - Scratch).
This version is a simple implementation.

In the future I plan to add the feature whereby you can eat fruits and then you can also gobble ghosts.

I borrowed the icons for the game from https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/pacman (Pacman icons created by Tahsin Tahil - Flaticon).
